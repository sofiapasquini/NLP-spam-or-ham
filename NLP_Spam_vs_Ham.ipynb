    "If the fitting time is important in a given industry context, the Gradient Boosting Classifier would create a significant bottleneck in any workflow and the Random Forest Classifier should be chosen. The Random Forest Classifier has a higher recall than the Gradient Boosting Classifier- that is to say it is better at picking out spam messages; this would be the ideal model for something like an email spam filter, for example. Overall, the Random Forest Classifier does appear to have a higher accuracy as well. As Gradient Boosting Classifiers are, relatively speaking, easier to overfit and slower to learn, a further analysis of training metrics and the effects of a larger sample size would be necessary to rule either of these effects out from result explanations."
